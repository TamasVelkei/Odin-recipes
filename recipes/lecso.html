    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
         Lecsó is a Hungarian staple made with sweet Hungarian peppers, onions, tomatoes, and paprika, 
         which are all stewed together in a bit of smoked bacon fat (or oil). It’s at its best when made from the kind of perfect tomatoes and peppers 
         that you find in late summer /early autumn. Lecsó is also such a beloved part of the Hungarian culinary canon that you might hear it used as a verb in Hungarian.
